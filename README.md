# Anime-Face-Dataset---GAN-Tensorflow

# Anime Face Generation using GAN (TensorFlow)

This project implements a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** in **TensorFlow** to generate anime-style faces.  
The model is trained on an anime face dataset and learns to create new, realistic-looking anime characters.
